## Starting üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

_See **Deployment** to learn how to deploy the project._

### Pre requirements üìã

Before installing the project you must have **Ruby** installed on your local machine and also a text editor for development.

**Text editor** _(I recommend Visual Studio Code)_
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com)

**Ruby** _(I recommend version 3+)_
[https://www.ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

**Bundle**
You must have bundle installed to be able to load the project's dependencies.
```
gem install bundler
```

### Install üîß

_Antes de realizar la instalaci√≥n verifica que tengas instalado correctamente Ruby, gem y bundle, de la siguiente forma:_

```
$ruby --version
@ruby 3.0.2p107 (2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233) [x86_64-linux-gnu] (This should be seen as a result)
```

```
$gem --version
3.3.5 (This should be seen as a result)
```

```
$bundle --version
Bundler version 2.4.20 (This should be seen as a result)
```

To install the project you must download it as a zip or clone it from this address:
<!-- ``` -->
[https://github.com/gonzafg2/Grupo_MOK_Tech_Lead.git](hhttps://github.com/gonzafg2/Grupo_MOK_Tech_Lead.git)
<!-- ``` -->

After having the files on your computer you must install, make sure you have all the dependencies installed on your local machine.

#### Dependencies üìã
* gem 'puma'
* gem 'money'
* gem 'httpx'
* gem 'erb'
* gem 'json'
* gem 'sinatra'

Run this command in a terminal:

```
sudo gem install puma money httpx erb json sinatra
```

Then you must install the project dependencies, for this you must execute the following command in a terminal:

```
bundle install
```
This will install all the dependencies necessary to run the application on your computer, which will be installed inside a folder called ***vendor***.

If everything went correctly you can see the app by executing the following command:

```
ruby app.rb
```

This will create a local server to view the project which you can access by entering one of these addresses: ***(Could be different on your computer)***

```
